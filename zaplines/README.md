SquareHopper game based on the one provided at the Python User Group meetup 13Nov18.

Runs on its own using 
`"pgzrun game.py"`

Game written after the meetup as an exercise. I got confused about how to do the fork and PR. Hopefully this is what was intended - a runnable game in a self-contained folder.
